SteamUser is a handler module for [node-steam](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam) version 1.0.0 or greater.
It also works with [node-steam-client](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-client).

It's designed to be a self-contained module which provides all the functionality expected of a Steam user client.

# Enums [^](#contents)

There are a lot of enums used in Steam. They're all available directly from `SteamUser`. For example, access `EResult`
using `SteamUser.EResult`.

All enums can be viewed [on GitHub](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/tree/master/enums).

Additionally, for convenience, the name of an enum value is available from any enum at the key identified by the enum
value. For example, given an EResult of `88` you can translate it using `SteamUser.EResult[88]` which gives you
the string `TwoFactorCodeMismatch`.

# Static Properties [^](#contents)

Static properties, or properties attached directly to `SteamUser`, are accessed on the root module and not on instantiated handler instances.

### Steam

The `node-steam-client` module installation used by `SteamUser`. You can use this in place of `require('steam-client')`
if you'd like to avoid duplicate installations. As of v3.7.0, all enums are built into `SteamUser` so you probably won't
need to use this. Example of using `EResult`:

```js
var ok = SteamUser.EResult.OK;
```

# Static Methods [^](#contents)

Static methods, or functions attached directly to `SteamUser`, are called on the root module and not on instantiated handler instances.

### formatCurrency(amount, currency)
- `amount` - The amount of the currency
- `currency` - The currency code value in the [`ECurrencyCode`](#ecurrencycode) enum

Formats a currency value and returns a string. For example:

```js
console.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(12.34, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.USD)); // $12.34
console.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(12345, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.JPY)); // � 12345
console.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(123.45, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.EUR)); // 123,45�
```

### generateAuthCode(secret[, timeOffset])
- `secret` - A `Buffer`, hex string, or base64 string containing your shared secret
- `timeOffset` - The number of seconds by which your local clock is off from the Steam servers. Defaults to 0.

Generates a 5-digit alphanumeric Steam Guard code for use with two-factor mobile authentication.

**Deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use [`steam-totp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) instead.**

# Options [^](#contents)

There are a number of options which can control the behavior of the `SteamUser` object. They are:

### dataDirectory

Controls where the Steam server list and sentry files are written. If `null`, no data will be automatically stored.

Defaults to a platform-specific user data directory.

- On [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com), this is `$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/node-steamuser`
- On Windows, this is `%localappdata%\doctormckay\node-steamuser`
- On Mac, this is `~/Library/Application Support/node-steamuser`
- On Linux, this is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/node-steamuser`, or `~/.local/share/node-steamuser` if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` isn't defined or is empty

#### Custom Storage Engine

If you don't want to (or can't) save data to the disk, you can implement your own storage engine. To do this, simply add the following code:

```js
user.storage.on('save', function(filename, contents, callback) {
	// filename is the name of the file, as a string
	// contents is a Buffer containing the file's contents
	// callback is a function which you MUST call on completion or error, with a single error argument

	// For example:
	someStorageSystem.saveFile(filename, contents, function(err) {
		callback(err);
	});
});

user.storage.on('read', function(filename, callback) {
	// filename is the name of the file, as a string
	// callback is a function which you MUST call on completion or error, with an error argument and a Buffer argument

	// For example:
	someStorageSystem.readFile(filename, function(err, file) {
		if(err) {
			callback(err);
			return;
		}

		callback(null, file);
	});
});
```

In this manner, you can save data to a database, a cloud service, or anything else you choose.

### autoRelogin

A boolean which controls whether or not `SteamUser` will automatically reconnect to Steam if disconnected due to Steam going down.

Defaults to `true`.

### singleSentryfile

A boolean which controls whether or not `SteamUser` will use a single sentry file for all accounts.

If off, a file named `sentry.accountname.bin` will be saved for each account.
If on, a file named `sentry.bin` will be used for all accounts.

Defaults to `false`.

### promptSteamGuardCode

A boolean which controls whether or not `SteamUser` will automatically prompt for Steam Guard codes when necessary from `stdin`.

Defaults to `true`.

### machineIdType

What kind of machine ID will SteamUser send to Steam when logging on? Should be a value from [`EMachineIDType`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/blob/master/resources/EMachineIDType.js).

Added in 1.7.0.

Defaults to `AccountNameGenerated`.

### machineIdFormat

If you're using `machineIdType` `AccountGenerated`, this is the format it uses. This is an array of three strings, each of which will be hashed with SHA1 before being sent to Steam. `{account_name}` will be replaced with the current account name.

Added in 1.13.0.

Defaults to `["SteamUser Hash BB3 {account_name}", "SteamUser Hash FF2 {account_name}", "SteamUser Hash 3B3 {account_name}"]`.

### enablePicsCache

If enabled, then `node-steam-user` will internally cache data about all apps and packages that it knows about.
Currently, `node-steam-user` "knows about" an app/package if:

- Packages
    - You own it
    - You request info about it via `getProductInfo`
- Apps
    - It's in a known package
    - You request info about it via `getProductInfo`
    - A friend who is online plays the app
    - You request info about an online user who is playing it via `getPersonas`

This option is required in order to use several methods and events. This works when logging in anonymously.

Added in 3.3.0.

Defaults to `false`.

### picsCacheAll

If enabled, `enablePicsCache` is enabled, and `changelistUpdateInterval` is nonzero, then apps and packages which get
updated while your bot is running will also be added to the cache. Default behavior is to only cache apps and packages
that are "known" via the above criteria.

Added in 3.3.0.

Defaults to `false`.

### changelistUpdateInterval

If `enablePicsCache` is enabled, then `node-steam-user` will automatically request app/package changes (via
`getProductChanges`) for known apps and packages, and update the internal cache when they update. Set to `0` to disable.

Added in 3.3.0.

Defaults to `60000`.

# Methods [^](#contents)

### Constructor([client][, options])
- `client` - An optional `SteamClient` to use to connect to Steam. If not provided, one will be created automatically.
- `options` - An optional object containing zero or more [options](#options-) to set for this `SteamUser`.

Constructs a new `SteamUser`. If you allow `SteamUser` to create its own `SteamClient`, then `SteamUser` will
automatically save and reload the CM server list.

### setOption(option, value)
- `option` - The name of the option to set
- `value` - The value to set for this option

Changes the value of an [option](#options-).

### setOptions(options)
- `options` - An object containing zero or more [options](#options-).

### setSentry(sentry)
- `sentry` - A Buffer containing the binary sentry file, binary SHA1 hash, or `null` to unset the set sentry

If you aren't using `dataDirectory` or you just want to provide your own sentry file, you can do it using this method.

You should call this before calling `logOn`. When you log on, `SteamUser` will use this sentry file.

You can provide either an entire sentryfile (preferred), or a Buffer containing the binary SHA1 hash of your sentryfile
(e.g. the output of the `sentry` event in node-steam 0.6.x).

### logOn([details])
- `details` - An object containing details for this logon
	- `accountName` - If logging into a user account, the account's name
	- `password` - If logging into an account without a login key, the account's password
	- `authCode` - If you have a Steam Guard email code, you can provide it here. You might not need to, see the [`steamGuard`](#steamguard) event. (Added in 1.9.0)
	- `twoFactorCode` - If you have a Steam Guard mobile two-factor authentication code, you can provide it here. You might not need to, see the [`steamGuard`](#steamguard) event. (Added in 1.9.0)
	- `loginKey` - If logging into an account with a login key, this is the account's login key
	- `rememberPassword` - `true` if you want to get a login key which can be used in lieu of a password for subsequent logins. `false` or omitted otherwise.
	- `logonID` - A number to identify this login. The official Steam client derives this from your machine's private IP (it's the `obfustucated_private_ip` field in `CMsgClientLogOn`). If you try to logon twice to the same account from the same public IP with the same `logonID`, the first session will be kicked with reason `SteamUser.EResult.LogonSessionReplaced`. Defaults to `0` if not specified.
	- `machineName` - A string containing the name of this machine that you want to report to Steam. This will be displayed on steamcommunity.com when you view your games list (when logged in).
	- `dontRememberMachine` - If you're providing an `authCode` but you don't want Steam to remember this sentryfile, pass `true` here.

**v3.11.0 or later is required to use `machineName` or `dontRememberMachine`.**

Logs onto Steam. The `CMClient`/`SteamClient` should **not** be already logged on, although as of v3.4.0 it can be
connected. Omit the `details` object if you wish to login to an anonymous user account.

### logOff()

Logs you off of Steam and closes the connection.

### relog()

**v3.18.0 or later is required to use this method**

Logs you off of Steam and then immediately back on. If you aren't logged into an anonymous account, then you **must**
set `rememberPassword` to `true` when logging on initially to use this. You also **must** wait for the
[`loginKey`](#loginkey) event to be emitted before you can use this. Attempts to call this method without both
criteria being met will result in an `Error` being thrown and nothing else will happen.

When used, `disconnected` and then `loggedOn` will be emitted in succession. This is essentially the same as using
`logOff()` and then calling `logOn()` immediately in the `disconnected` event callback.

### webLogOn()

`SteamUser` will automatically log onto steamcommunity.com when a successful connection to Steam is established (as an
individual user), but you can call `webLogOn()` to create a new session if your old one expires or becomes invalid.

Listen for the [`webSession`](#websession) event to get your cookies.

### createAccount(accountName, password, email, callback)
- `accountName` - The username of your new account
- `password` - The password for your new account
- `email` - The contact email for your new account
- `callback` - Called when the account is either created or an error occurs

		- `SteamUser.EResult.IllegalPassword` if your password is too weak or otherwise bad
		- or something else on another error
	- `steamid` - If successful, this is a `SteamID` object containing the new account's SteamID

Creates a new individual user Steam account. You must be logged on either anonymously or as an existing individual user
to use this.

**Currently it seems that Steam is not properly sending back the SteamID of the newly-created account. The `steamid`
argument in the callback is currently `null`.**

### requestValidationEmail([callback])
- `callback` - Optional. Called when a response is available
	- `result` - A value from `SteamUser.EResult`. `SteamUser.EResult.OK` if the mail was sent successfully.

Requests Steam to send you a validation email to your registered email address.

### enableTwoFactor(callback)
- `callback` - Required. Called when the activation email has been sent.
	- `response` - An object containing the response data

**v2.0.0 or later is required to use this method**

Starts the process to turn on TOTP for your account. You must have a phone number already linked with and verified on your account.

You'll be sent an SMS with an activation code that you'll need to provide to `finalizeTwoFactor`.

**You should save the entire `response` object somewhere secure.** You can use `JSON.stringify` on it safely.

Properties of note in the `response` object:
- `status` - A value from `EResult`. If this is not `OK` (1), then the request failed.
- `shared_secret` - This is your secret that's used for two-factor authentication.

**v2.0.0 or later is required to use this method**

Finishes the process of enabling TOTP two-factor authentication for your account. You can use [`steam-totp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) in the future when logging on to get a code.

**If TOTP two-factor authentication is enabled, a code will be required *on every login* unless a `loginKey` is used.**

### disableTwoFactor(options, callback)

    - `twoFactorCode` - Optional (if you don't have 2FA enabled). If you do have 2FA (Mobile Authenticator) enabled, this is your current 2FA code (when confirming `code`).
    - `smsCode` - Optional (if Steam doesn't want it). See below.
- `callback` - Optional. Called when the request completes.
    - `err` - `null` on success, or an `Error` object on failure
    - `needsSmsCode` - `true` if Steam wants an SMS verification code (see below).

**v3.13.0 or later is required to use this method.**

Performs both steps in the two-step process that is changing your account's contact email. First, call this with only
your `password` and `newEmail`. This will cause Steam to send an email to your new email address containing a
verification code. Once you have that code, call this again with your `password`, `newEmail`, and `code`.

If you have a Mobile Authenticator (2FA) enabled on your account, then for the second request you will need to include
your current 2FA code as `twoFactorCode`. If you don't and `needsSmsCode` was `true` in the callback to the first request,
then Steam has sent a verification code in an SMS to your phone. In this case, you need to provide that code as `smsCode`
in the second request.

`needsSmsCode` may still be `true` in the callback to the second request. In this case, simply ignore it. If you received
no `err`, then your email was changed. The [`emailInfo`](#emailinfo-1) event will be emitted when your email changes.

**Changing your account's email will start a 5-day trading cooldown.**

Requests a free-on-demand license to be granted to your account.

Older free-to-play games are in the "Steam" package ([package ID 0](https://steamdb.info/sub/0/)). This package is
automatically granted to all accounts (but not anonymous ones). Games in this package do not need a license to be
explicitly requested.

All newer free-to-play games have "free-on-demand packages". These are packages that are not automatically granted to
all accounts, but will be granted upon request ("on demand"). This is so that the Steam client can show free-to-play
games you have previously added to your library when not installed. In order to "play" any free-to-play app that isn't
in sub 0, you need to request a license for it using this method.

If successful, calling this method will result in the [`licenses`](#licenses-1) event being emitted containing your new
license(s).

### getEncryptedAppTicket(appid[, userData], callback)
- `appid` - The Steam AppID of the app for which you want a ticket
- `userData` - If the app expects some "user data" (arbitrary data which will be encrypted into the ticket), provide it here. Otherwise, omit this argument or pass an empty Buffer.
- `callback` - Called when the request completes
    - `err` - If there was an error, this is an `Error` object. Otherwise, it's `null`.
    - `ticket` - If successful, this is your encrypted appticket as a Buffer. You should provide the entire contents of the Buffer to the recipient.

**v3.14.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests an "encrypted app ticket" from Steam servers for a particular game. This can be used to prove your ownership of
an app and also your account identity to some publisher server, provided they're expecting an encrypted app ticket.
To use encrypted app tickets, publishers must set up an encryption key in the Steamworks backend. Therefore, this will
not work if encrypted tickets haven't been set up for the AppID you request a ticket for. You cannot decrypt an
encrypted app ticket, nor can you view anything it contains. It is for all intents and purposes an opaque blob of binary
data which only the developer/publisher of the game can do anything with.

# Events [^](#contents)

## ID Events

Events marked as **ID events** are special. They all have a `SteamID` object as their first parameter. In addition to the event itself firing, a second event comprised of `eventName + "#" + steamID.getSteamID64()` is fired.

For example:

```js
// This will fire when we receive a chat message from ANY friend
user.on('friendMessage', function(steamID, message) {
	console.log("Friend message from " + steamID.getSteam3RenderedID() + ": " + message);
});

// This will fire when we receive a chat message from [U:1:46143802] / 76561198006409530 ONLY
user.on('friendMessage#76561198006409530', function(steamID, message) {
	console.log("Friend message from " + steamID.getSteam3RenderedID() + ": " + message);
});
```

### loggedOn
- `details` - An object containing various details about your account (see [`CMsgClientLogonResponse`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/SteamKit_1.6.3/Resources/Protobufs/steamclient/steammessages_clientserver.proto#L93-L116))
- `parental` - An object containing your parental controls settings

**v3.5.0 or later is required to use `parental`.**

Emitted when you're successfully logged into Steam.

### steamGuard
- `domain` - If an email code is needed, the domain name of the address where the email was sent. `null` if an app code is needed.
- `callback` - Should be called when the code is available.
	- `code` - The Steam Guard auth code
- `lastCodeWrong` - `true` if you're using 2FA and the last code you provided was wrong, `false` otherwise

If the `promptSteamGuardCode` option is disabled, this event will be emitted when Steam requests a Steam Guard code from us. You should collect the code from the user somehow and then call the `callback` with the code as the sole argument.

Example:

```js
user.on('steamGuard', function(domain, callback) {
	console.log("Steam Guard code needed from email ending in " + domain);
	var code = getCodeSomehow();
	callback(code);
});
```

### error
- `err` - An `Error` object

Emitted when an error occurs during logon. Also emitted if we're disconnected and `autoRelogin` is either disabled, or it's a fatal disconnect.

If this event isn't handled, the program will crash.

The `SteamUser` object's `steamID` property will still be defined when this is emitted. The `Error` object will have an `eresult` parameter which is a value from the [`EResult`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/SteamKit_1.6.3/Resources/SteamLanguage/eresult.steamd) enum.

### disconnected
- `eresult` - A value from the `SteamUser.EResult` enum
- `msg` - A string describing the reason for the disconnect, if available (might be undefined)

Emitted when we're disconnected from Steam for a non-fatal reason and `autoRelogin` is enabled. `SteamUser` will
continually retry connection and will either emit `loggedOn` when logged back on, or `error` if a fatal logon error is
experienced.

Also emitted in response to a logOff() call.

The `SteamUser` object's `steamID` property will still be defined when this is emitted.

The `eresult` value might be 0 (Invalid), which indicates that the disconnection was due to the connection being closed
directly, without Steam sending a LoggedOff message.

### sentry
- `sentry` - A Buffer containing your new sentry file

Emitted when Steam sends us a new sentry file. By default, `SteamUser` will automatically save and reuse this sentry file for subsequent logins, but if you wish you may handle it yourself (see [`setSentry`](#setsentrysentry)).

### webSession
- `sessionID` - The value of the `sessionid` cookie
- `cookies` - An array of cookies, as `name=value` strings

Emitted when a steamcommunity.com web session is successfully negotiated. This will automatically be emitted on logon and in response to [`webLogOn`](#weblogon) calls.

Some libraries require you to provide your `sessionID`, others don't. If your library doesn't, you can safely ignore it.

### loginKey
- `key` - Your login key

If you enabled `rememberPassword` in [`logOn`](#logondetails), this will be emitted when Steam sends us a new login key. This key can be passed to [`logOn`](#logondetails) as `loginKey` in lieu of a password on subsequent logins.

At this time, I'm not sure if login keys expire, so to be safe you should record this somewhere (in a database, in a file, etc) and overwrite it every time the event is emitted.

### newItems
- `count` - How many new items you have (can be 0)

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of new items. You can reset the count to 0 by loading your inventory page (https://steamcommunity.com/my/inventory) while logged in.

### newComments

- `myItems` - How many of the total comments are on your content (workshop items, screenshots, your profile, etc.)

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of new comments.

### tradeOffers

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of new trade offers.

### offlineMessages
- `count` - How many unread offline chat messages you have
- `friends` - An array of SteamID strings for the users who have sent you unread offline chat messages

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of unread offline chat messages. This will always be emitted after logon, even if you have no messages.

### vanityURL
- `url` - Your new vanity URL

**v3.7.0 or later is required to use this event**

- `facebookName` - If your account is linked with Facebook, this is your (real) name on Facebook

**v3.4.0 or later is required to use this event**

### gifts
- `gifts` - An array of gift objects

Emitted on logon and when you receive/accept/decline a gift or guest pass. The [`gifts`](#gifts) property will be
updated after this event is emitted.

Guest Passes (do they even still exist?) are gifts (actually, gifts are Guest Passes with a very long expiration date).
Consequently, both come through this event.

Each object in the array is an oustanding gift or guest pass that was sent to you that you haven't accepted/declined yet.
Only **outstanding** gifts show up here. Gifts that you stored in your inventory don't show up here.

The structure of the objects in the array is defined in the documentation for the [`gifts`](#gifts) property.

### appOwnershipCached
